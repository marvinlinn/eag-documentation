## 1. Deposition Chamber Purpose
{: .fw-700}
Room 113 (commonly known as the ‚Äútube lab‚Äù) contains a vacuum thermal evaporation thin film deposition chamber. The chamber is operated under vacuum and thermally evaporates a range of metal substrates (nichrome, silver, gold, nickel, etc.) in order to coat a variety of surfaces (MCPs, Windows, etc.) to a variety of depths. The thin film generated has many different use cases, ranging from improving the effectiveness of the device being coated, to facilitating the physical construction of certain devices. 

Of note, MCPs are often coated with nichrome in order to improve its quantum efficiency characteristics, and/or create a surface for electronic contact. Windows may be coated with nichrome to assist with photocathode imaging characteristics (qe improvements, creating a voltage bias, etc.), but are commonly coated with a mixture of copper, silver, and gold to assist with the creation of MCP based ‚Äútubes‚Äù (this metal combination makes it easier for the window to bond with the tube body).

## 2. Chamber Description
{: .fw-700}
This section intends on describing the thin film deposition system (pictured in Figure 1) within the clean room of  room 113 with an emphasis on the locations of critical components/controls. It consists of the positioning apparatus (see section 2.1), a bell jar and faraday cage (see section 2.2), as well as equipment used to operate vacuum & deposition processes(see section 2.3).

#### 2.1 Deposition Positioning Apparatus (DPA)
{: .fw-700}
The deposition positioning apparatus (see Figure TBD) is responsible for properly orienting the device undergoing deposition. The positioning apparatus can be broken down into 2 different parts, the supports which modify the structure angle (…∏, see section 3.2.3 for definition), and a machine (see Figure TBD) controlling the pore correction angle (ùëù, see section 3.2.4 for definition) and rotation angle (‚ç¥, see section 3.2.5 for definition). The machine consists of a deposition plate, the nuts and bolts constraining the orientation of the MCP plate (and thus pore bias angle, ùõΩ, see section 3.2.1 for definition), and a motor for adjusting the rotation angle (‚ç¥, see section 3.2.5 for definition). The constant rotation generated by the motor ensures an even deposition on the device.  

#### 2.2 Deposition Bell Jar & Faraday Cage
{: .fw-700}
The bell jar & faraday cage (see Figure TBD) are used to establish the vacuum needed to operate the deposition equipment, and protect the process from outside interference. It may be raised and lowered by the lift, which is operated by a front facing control panel (see Figure TBD). When raising or lowering the bell jar and faraday cage, take care to ensure nothing internal or external is accidentally damaged.
