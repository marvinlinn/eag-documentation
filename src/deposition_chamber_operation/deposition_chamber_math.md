## Introduction
{: .fw-700}
It is important to understand the underlying theory behind how the deposition chamber operates in order to ensure effective & accurate operation. In line with this thinking, the following sections will detail 2 different approaches for the derivation of operating angles (which are applied to the positioning apparatus).

## Term Definitions
{: .fw-700}

####  Pore Bias Angle (ùú∑)
{: .fw-700}
The pore bias angle refers to the angular offset present in MCPs (see Figure TBD below). This bias directly affects the imaging characteristics of MCPs.


#### Deposition Depth (d)
{: .fw-700}
Deposition depth refers to the depth of the thin film deposition. It is determined by the distance between the entrance of the MCP pore and furthest visible edge of the MCP pore (see Figure TBD below).
