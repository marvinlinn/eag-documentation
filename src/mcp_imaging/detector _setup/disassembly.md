# Backfilling and Disassembling a Test Detector

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
The following page provides an overview of detector build-up of a 33mm MCP detector. Build-up usually occurs in RM125. 

---

## Introduction
{: .fw-700 }

When testing is completed, the pumping cart should be powered down and the detector should be disassembled for safekeeping. The following steps will outline the process for backfilling the system with N2 and test detector disassembly.

## Procedure
{: .fw-700 }
#### Step 0: Workbench Setup
{: .fw-700 }

Before we move forwards with breakdown of a detector, ensure that your workbench is appropriately setup for detector disassembly. Clean the bench with q quick isopropanol wipe, and (optionally) place and tape down a clean sheet of aluminum foil. Collect the tools you need for disassembly. Here is a rough guideline of tools you may need:

| Tools        | Location         |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| T7 Torx wrench | Class 100 Workbench, Tool Rack |
| Dental picks | Class 100 Workbench |
| Tweezers | Class 100 Workbench |
| Petri Dishes | Class 100 Workbench |
| MCP Containers | "MCP UNDER TEST" Container on Class 100 Workbench |
| Wrenches | Class 100 Workbench, Tool Rack |
| Test detector base holder | Class 100 Workbench **OR** N2 Cabinet|
| MCP Cover | Class 100 Workbench, Petri Dishes |

#### Step 1: Powering Down the Pumping Cart
{: .fw-700 }

In order to properly power down the vaccuum pumping setup, we must appropriately close each valve and power down the system.

1. Close the main system valve.
2. Power down the turbopump using the turbopump controller. Wait until it has fully spun down to avoid damaging the pump.
3. Power down the scroll pump.
4. Turn on the N2 supply.
5. Open the N2 backfilling/venting valve. Wait until pressure has stabilized.
6. Close the backfilling/venting valve and close the N2 supply line.

#### Step 2: Removing the Test Detector

Once the pumping cart and detector assembly is powered down and backfilled with N2, you can remove the detector from the pumping cart. Locate the C clamp and unscrew until the clamp comes off. Carefully pull off the detector and cover the exposed port with aluminum foil.

#### Step 3: Window Removal

The test detector can now be place on a Class 100 workbench for disassembly. Remove the silver plated bolts and nuts from the test detector using two **Wrenches**. This process is easier with multiple people.

> Once there is only a single bolt left, the front window may come loose and pivot. **Be extra careful at this stage.**
