# Assembling and Pumping Down a Test Detector

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
The following page provides an overview of detector build-up of a 33mm MCP detector. Build-up usually occurs in RM125.

#### Step 0: Identify Testing Parameters
{: .fw-700 }

Before building a test detector, first identify the testing parameter of your setup. A few key questions to ask:

- What plates are you testing?
- How are the plates intended to be stacked?
- How are the plate oriented (flipped)?

Having and understanding of exactly how the detector should be configued will ensure a straightforwards design process

#### Step 1: Workbench Setup

Before we move forwards with breakdown of a detector, ensure that your workbench is appropriately setup for detector disassembly. Clean the bench with q quick isopropanol wipe, and (optionally) place and tape down a clean sheet of aluminum foil. Collect the tools you need for disassembly. Here is a rough guideline of tools you may need:

| Tools        | Location         |
