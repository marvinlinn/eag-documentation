# Detector Setup

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
The following page provides an overview of detector build-up of a 33mm MCP detector. Build-up usually occurs in RM125.

> In order to determine the performance of the MCPs, one of the first tests to be conducted is imaging the gain charecteristics of the plates.
> Due to manufacturing defects and varying performance due to manufacturing methodology (ALD, etc.), the for the plates can vary signifiacntly.
> To charecterize the behavior of MCPs, we build them into a test detector and **image the plates to see gain behavior of the plates**.

## Assembling and Pumping Down a Test Detector

### 1. Identify Testing Parameters

Before building a test detector, first identify the testing parameter of your setup. A few key questions to ask:

- What plates are you testing?
- How are the plates intended to be stacked?
- How are the plate oriented (flipped)?

Having and understanding of exactly how the detector should be configued will ensure a straightforwards design process

### 2. Collect Necessary Components






## Backfilling and Disassembling a Test Detector

When testing is completed, the pumping cart should be powered down and the detector should be disassembled for safekeeping. The following steps will outline the process for backfilling the system with N2 and test detector disassembly.

#### Step 0: Workbench Setup

Before we move forwards with breakdown of a detector, ensure that 

#### Step 1: Powering Down the Pumping Cart
{: .fw-700 }

In order to properly power down the vaccuum pumping setup, we must appropriately close each valve and power down the system.

1. Close the main system valve.
2. Power down the turbopump using the turbopump controller. Wait until it has fully spun down to avoid damaging the pump.
3. Power down the scroll pump.
4. Turn on the N2 supply.
5. Open the N2 backfilling/venting valve. Wait until pressure has stabilized.
6. Close the backfilling/venting valve and close the N2 supply line.

#### Step 2: Removing the Test Detector

Once the pumping cart and detector assembly is powered down and backfilled with N2, you can remove the detector from the pumping cart. Locate the C clamp and unscrew until the clamp comes off. Carefully pull off the detector and cover the exposed port with aluminum foil.

The test detector can now be place on a Class 100 workbench for disassembly.
