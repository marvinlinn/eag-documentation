# Detector Setup

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
The following page provides an overview of detector build-up of a 33mm MCP detector. Build-up usually occurs in RM125.

> In order to determine the performance of the MCPs, one of the first tests to be conducted is imaging the gain charecteristics of the plates.
> Due to manufacturing defects and varying performance due to manufacturing methodology (ALD, etc.), the for the plates can vary signifiacntly.
> To charecterize the behavior of MCPs, we build them into a test detector and **image the plates to see gain behavior of the plates**.
